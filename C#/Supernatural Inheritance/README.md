 Supernatural Inheritance

Supernatural Inheritance was the Twelth project I did and was part of the Interfaces and Iheritance section of the C# course. 

This code stores information on three types of Magicians: the Pupil, the Mage, and the Archmage. The Pupil has one spell (CastWindStorm) which is inherited by the Mage, who gains a new spell (CastRainStorm). The Archmage inherits both spells while upgrading (CastRainStorm) to a strong spell and gaining the spell (CastLightningStorm). The code stores this information and then asks different mages to cast spells according to their Magician rank. 

Thanks for reading the README :)
