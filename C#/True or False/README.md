 True or False

True or False was the Ninth project I did and was part of the Arrays and Loops section of the C# course. 

This code takes a users inputs in several test questions where they asked to enter "true" or "false." The code tells them their input, the correct answer, and the score they received on their test.

Thanks for reading the README :)
