 Password Checker

Password Checker was the fourth project I did and was part of the Logic and Conditionals section of the C# course. 

This code takes a password input from the user and gives it a score based on how many points of the list (below) it hits. It then returns an output to the user if the password is weak, medium, strong, or extremely strong. Or, if the user just presses Enter and doesnt enter a password, it will tell the user that the password doesn't meet any of the standards.

-is at least 8 characters long
-has lowercase letters
-has uppercase letters
-has numerical digits
-has symbols, like #, ?, !
