 Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher was the Eigth project I did and was part of the Arrays and Loops section of the C# course. 

This code takes a users input and encrypts it using the Caesar Cipher and outputs the encrypted message back to the user. The Caesar Cipher takes each letter and moves it three spaces in the alphabet, so "hello" would be outputed as "choor." 

Thanks for reading the README :)
