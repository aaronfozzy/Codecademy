 Choose Your Own Adventure

Choose Your Own Adventure was the fifth project I did and was part of the Logic and Conditionals section of the C# course. 

This code takes the users inputs and takes the user on a small journey. The outcome of the journey depends on the users inputs at each leg of the journey. 

Thanks for reading the README :)
