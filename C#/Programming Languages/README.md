 Programming Languages

Programming Languages was the Fourteenth and final project I did and was part of the Lists and LINQ section of the C# course. 

This code stores information all of the various coding languages that have been released since 1990 in a list. The objective of this project was unclear and it seemed to just be a last minute put together project designed to get the user to put Lists and LINQ into practice with no real goal in mind. There was no video walkthough of this project either unlike every other project, which I believe further proves my point. Anyway, the code outputs many lines of text with information regarding coding languages and is quite a lot to look at. Seems a bit messy to me, but I followed what they asked and ended up here.

Thanks for reading the README :)
