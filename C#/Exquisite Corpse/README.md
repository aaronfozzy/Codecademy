 Exquisite Corpse

Exquisite Corpse was the seventh project I did and was part of the Methods section of the C# course. 

This code builds a creature with a head, body, and feet. The creature's parts can be ghost, monster, or bug and can be mixed and matched. The code asks if the user would like to manual create the monster or let it be random. The rest is pretty self explanatory; if the user types "manual," the code will ask the user what creature to use for the head, then the body, then the feet, and output the creature they have created. If the user chose "random," the code will return a randomly assorted creature to them.

Thanks for reading the README :)
