 Architect Arithmetic

Architect Arithmetic was the sixth project I did and was part of the Methods section of the C# course. 

This code takes the dimensions of the blueprints of the Teotihuacan and calculates the area of the building trough finding the area of a rectangle, triangle, and semi-circle. It then takes the area and multiplies that by how many pesos it costs per square meters and outputs the total cost of the blueprinted building. 

Thanks for reading the README :)
