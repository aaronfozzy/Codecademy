 App Interfaces

App Interfaces was the Eleventh project I did and was part of the Interfaces and Iheritance section of the C# course. 

This code stores a To Do List and a Password. The password's hidden setting can be true or false. If true, the output of the display will show the actual password. If false, the output will be all asterisks (*******). The output will also show all of the current tasks on the To Do List. 

Thanks for reading the README :)
