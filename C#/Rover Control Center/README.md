 Rover Control Center

Rover Control Center was the Thirteenth project I did and was part of the References section of the C# course. 

This code stores information on the various different space probes in outer space and allows you direct all of the probes at once. The code outputs all of the data regarding the probes and tells you where they're exploring and what they're collecting. 

Thanks for reading the README :)
