 The Object of Your Affection

The Object of Your Affection was the Tenth project I did and was part of the Classes and Objects section of the C# course. 

This code outputs the dating profile of Sam Drakkila (Codecademy provided the details). The Profile.cs code is what creates and outputs the profile, while the Program.cs inputs the information and initializes the code.

Thanks for reading the README :)
