 Mad Libs

Mad Libs was the second project I did and was part of the Data Types and Variables section of the C# course. This one took me a while as I was not overly familiar with how to read error messages, and I also kept forgetting to put semi colons in my code as I had gotten used to HTML. 

This piece of code takes inputs from the user like name, adjectives, and verbs to name a few, and it inserts these inputs into a Mad Libs story.

Thanks for reading the README :)
